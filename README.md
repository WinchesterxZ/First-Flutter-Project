# My First Flutter Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my first Flutter project - just a simple screen I made while learning the basics.

## What's in it?

Nothing fancy really, just a screen with:
- A blue app bar with a centered title
- Two round images side by side
  - One loads from the internet (using picsum for a random photo)
  - One comes from the assets folder
- A text label below the images


## ScreenShot

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure you have Flutter installed
3. Run `flutter pub get` to grab the dependencies
4. Hit run and you're good to go!

## Note
Don't forget to add your own image in the assets/images folder named 'img.jpg' or update the asset path in the code.
